***A stock market predictor Android App that utilizes retrospective analysis
to create a stochastic model for predicting future market behavior***

Overview:
In the modern stock market, financial enthusiasts from all fields are attempting to forecast the
trends of a plethora of stocks. As the market has been around for decades now, it follows that
many mathematical attempts to model the behavior of stocks exist; however, there has been a lack
of exploration into the application of such models in the form of mobile applications. We
consequently decided to implement our own flavor of a mathematical model that accomplishes
the complex forecasting of fluctuating stocks within the convenience of an Android application. 

Approach:
We use a stochastic model to treat stocks as semi-random agents, bounded by drift and influenced
by volatility, in order to make a prediction that uses a random, noise generating function to
make future predictions as to how stocks will behave.

Future:
We plan to launch this app on the marketplace free of charge for use by anyone, maintain
the github repositiory, and potentially accept future pull requests from third parties.
