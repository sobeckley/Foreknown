***Foreknown--A stock market predictor Android App that utilizes retrospective analysis
to create a stochastic model for predicting future market behavior***

Overview:
In the modern stock market, financial enthusiasts from all fields are attempting to forecast the
trends of a plethora of stocks. As the market has been around for decades now, it follows that
many mathematical attempts to model the behavior of stocks exist; however, there has been a lack
of exploration into the application of such models in the form of mobile applications. We
consequently decided to implement our own flavor of a mathematical model that accomplishes
the complex forecasting of fluctuating stocks within the convenience of an Android application. 

Approach:
We use a stochastic model to treat stocks as semi-random agents, bounded by drift and influenced
by volatility, in order to make a prediction that uses a random, noise generating function to
make future predictions as to how stocks will behave. Consequently, we graph the vectorized
data from the mathematical model to display the predictions; as a sample, we have included 
the stock data for HP.

Future:
We plan to launch this app on the marketplace free of charge for use by anyone, maintain
the github repositiory, and potentially accept future pull requests from third parties.
Additionally, we will work towards refining the application--in particular, we hope to
implement a query system that can access stock prices from a market database.


Thank you for your time and interest!
